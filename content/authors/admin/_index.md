I am a PhD student with [Prof. Roberto Calandra](https://robertocalandra.com) at the [Learning, Adaptive Systems, and Robotics (LASR) Lab](https://lasr.org) at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de). My research focuses on model-based and hierarchical reinforcement learning applied to robotics.

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Frank Fitzek](https://cn.ifn.et.tu-dresden.de/chair/staff/fitzek) on using machine learning in the context of communication networks and transportation systems.
