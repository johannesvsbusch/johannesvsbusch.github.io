I am moving to a new job. 

After 3 years at the [Deutsche Telekom Chair of Communication Networks](https://cn.ifn.et.tu-dresden.de), I am starting as a PhD student at the newfound the [Learning, Adaptive Systems, and Robotics (LASR) Lab](lasr.org) with [Prof. Calandra's](robertocalandra.com) as my advisor.

My research will focus on model-based and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
