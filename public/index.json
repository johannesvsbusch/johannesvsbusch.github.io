Existing Edge SLAM approaches incur relatively high delays for offloading, resulting in high failure probabilities, i.e., low reliability, for commonly used public SLAM datasets. We discovered that two parameters which had not previously been studied in detail, namely the number of features and the number of keyframes that are bundled for a local map update, play a critical role in the offloading delay. Also, previous approaches updated the local map in the mobile device in a serial manner, incurring map update latencies. We study the numbers of features and bundled keyframes in detail and we parallelize the local map update. We find that judicious parameter settings, namely relatively small numbers of features (750 per frame) and bundled keyframes (1, i.e., effectively no bundling), reduce the map update latency to less than half compared to the previously common settings (1000 features per frame and 6 keyframes used for a map update). For a low network latency of 20ms, these judicious parameter settings in conjunction with our parallelized local map updating, reduce the 79% failure rate of the previous Edge SLAM systems down to 2%.","tags":[],"title":"Optimizing Edge SLAM: Judicious Parameter Settings and Parallelized Map Updates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian L.

Predicting handovers in high mobility scenarios enables networks and applications to adapt ahead of time to improve the Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we present a two-step machine learning (ML) method, consisting of a classifier and regressor, that can predict the remaining time until a handover occurs. Our approach is validated on a dataset that was captured in a real cellular network. The results show that upcoming handovers can be detected with a recall above 90% and the timing of handovers with an error smaller than one second. Furthermore, we compare the importance of input features derived from radio conditions and user locations for the ML models and discuss deployment scenarios of our approach. In particular, our results suggest that cell-based models perform better than models trained for larger areas.","tags":[],"title":"Handover Predictions as an Enabler for Anticipatory Service Adaptations in Next-Generation Cellular Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Ingo Grohmann","Johannes V.

Many of those robots work fully automatically and without human intervention. However, more complex tasks still require to be done by a human in remote control. One example would be robot remote surgery. Remote controlling a robot requires ultra- low latency on the communication, to allow fast and precise movements. To make this possible with today’s systems, the human operator must be in the same room. Enabling the user to operate from anywhere around the world, would bring a huge benefit as travels for highly trained experts can be minimized.In order to allow wider distances between the user and robot, we propose an AI-based prediction. Predicting the robots behavior can generate negative latency, which improves the precision of control. In large-scale communication networks, the main part of experienced latency comes from the propagation delay and is therefore not avoidable. Predicting upcoming data before it actually arrives, can create a zero-latency experience for the human operator. To prove this idea in the context of remote robot control, we propose JAVRIS. Using the CMIYC demonstrator, JAVRIS improved the score of an inexperienced user by over 1000%.","tags":[],"title":"JAVRIS: Joint Artificial Visual Prediction and Control for Remote-(Robot) Interaction Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes V.
